\begin{abstract}
Weak-lensing projects---to measure galaxy--galaxy lensing or the shear--shear
correlation function---often make use of estimators that involve simple or weighted
means of measured galaxy ellipticities.  Here we propose moving to a probabilistic inference
framework for weak-lensing projects, in which the both the distribution of unlensed
(intrinsic) galaxy ellipticities and the distribution of ellipticity measurement noise contributions
are both treated as priors.  We perform hierarchical inference to \emph{infer} the
unlensed ellipticity distribution simultaneously with the shear map.  The best
shear-field estimators (point estimates), in this context, become
maximum-\emph{marginalized}-likelihood estimates, in which uncertainty about the
inferred unlensed distribution has been marginalized out.  We show that our proposed
estimators perform better than simple mean-ellipticity estimators both in terms of
bias and variance.  We also show that as the number of observed galaxies becomes
large, the performance of our proposed estimators approaches the performance of a
magical maximum-likelihood estimator that could be constructed if the true unlensed
ellipticity distribution were known \textit{a priori}.  Importantly, this work only
considers the \emph{catalog-level} problem of how to combine galaxy ellipticity
measurements; it does not consider the problem of making those measurements in the
first place.  In the end we argue that weak lensing projects ought to move beyond
point estimates and instead propagate full likelihood-function information about
the shear field forward into scientific analyses.  Only this could properly
propagate uncertainty without introducing additional catalog-generated variance.

\flag{Yike}{Plan the sections of your paper, and write very brief notes on
what you want to say in each of them. You will find it helpful to divide
them into sub-sections, and even paragraphs. You may also want to put in
placeholder figures and tables; if you do, make sure to write the captions of
them. The itemized conclusions should be partial answers to a corresponding
list of questions in the introduction. You can write these now, as incomplete
statements: when you know what your findings are, you can complete them.}
