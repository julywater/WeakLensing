\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\flag{Yike}{Plan the sections of your paper, and write very brief notes on
what you want to say in each of them. You will find it helpful to divide
them into sub-sections, and even paragraphs. You may also want to put in
placeholder figures and tables; if you do, make sure to write the captions of
them. The itemized conclusions should be partial answers to a corresponding
list of questions in the introduction. You can write these now, as incomplete
statements: when you know what your findings are, you can complete them.}

% WL as cosmological and astrophysical probe. 

% Information is scarce. 
% Expensive, high precision future. Motivation.

% This paper: toy problem, exploring one aspect of analysis.

% History of shear estimation, and treatment of Pr(e).
