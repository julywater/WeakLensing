\begin{abstract}
Weak-lensing projects---to measure galaxy--galaxy lensing or the shear--shear
correlation function---often make use of estimators that involve simple or weighted
means of measured galaxy ellipticities.  Here we propose moving to a probabilistic inference
framework for weak-lensing projects, in which the both the distribution of unlensed
(intrinsic) galaxy ellipticities and the distribution of ellipticity measurement noise contributions
are both treated as priors.  We perform hierarchical inference to \emph{infer} the
unlensed ellipticity distribution simultaneously with the shear map.  The best
shear-field estimators (point estimates), in this context, become
maximum-\emph{marginalized}-likelihood estimates, in which uncertainty about the
inferred unlensed distribution has been marginalized out.  We show that our proposed
estimators perform better than simple mean-ellipticity estimators both in terms of
bias and variance.  We also show that as the number of observed galaxies becomes
large, the performance of our proposed estimators approaches the performance of a
magical maximum-likelihood estimator that could be constructed if the true unlensed
ellipticity distribution were known \textit{a priori}.  Importantly, this work only
considers the \emph{catalog-level} problem of how to combine galaxy ellipticity
measurements; it does not consider the problem of making those measurements in the
first place.  In the end we argue that weak lensing projects ought to move beyond
point estimates and instead propagate full likelihood-function information about
the shear field forward into scientific analyses.  Only this could properly
propagate uncertainty without introducing additional catalog-generated variance.

\section{method}
\label{sec:XXX}

\subsection{Likelihood Function}

We assume Lensed galaxy ellipticity $\epsilon_{\ell}$ is related
to the intrinsic galaxy ellipticity $\epsilon_{0}$ in the weak lensing
regime via
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\ell}=\frac{\epsilon_{0}+g}{1+g^{*}\epsilon_{0}}
\end{equation}


and it's inverse formula 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{0}=\frac{\epsilon_{\ell}-g}{1-g^{*}\epsilon_{\ell}}
\end{equation}
from Schramm \& Kayser (1995), Seitz \& Schneider (1997), where $\epsilon$
is represented as a complex variable and g, $g^{*}$ are the reduced
shear and its complex conjugate, respectively. $\epsilon$ is defined
in terms of the major and minor axes and orientation a, b, $\phi$,
respectively, as e = (a âˆ’ b)/(a + b) exp(2i$\phi$). Due to the isotropic
of Universe ,we expect $\phi$has a uniform distribution from 0 to
$\pi$.Then we can expect 
\begin{equation}
<\epsilon_{\ell}>=g
\end{equation}


So $<\epsilon_{\ell}>$ can be adopted as an estimator of g.

However in our hierachical Bayesian approach we are able to obtain
the posterior distribution of g ,starting from the same formulas.

Suppose we know the ellipticity distribution of unlensed galaxies
based on some parasmeters $\alpha$,the likelihood of reduced shear
$g$ and parameter $\alpha$ is like:

\begin{equation}
L(\vec{g},\alpha|\epsilon_{\ell})=p(\epsilon_{\ell}|\vec{g},\alpha)=P(\epsilon_{0}(\vec{g})|\alpha)*|\frac{\partial\epsilon_{0}}{\partial\epsilon_{\ell}}|
\end{equation}


Note that both $\epsilon_{0}$ and $\epsilon_{\ell}$are complex numbers.So
$|\frac{\partial\epsilon_{0}}{\partial\epsilon_{\ell}}|$ is the Jacobian
determinant term,which can be calculated numerically from formula
(5).

If there is measurement error on $\epsilon_{ob}$,we will have 
\begin{equation}
L(\vec{g},\alpha|\epsilon_{ob})=p(\epsilon_{ob}|\vec{g},\alpha)=\int f(\epsilon_{ob}|\epsilon_{\ell})p(\epsilon_{\ell}|\vec{g},\alpha)
\end{equation}
Here the prior distribtuion we use for $\vec{g}$ is a 2Dflat distribution
in the region $|g|<1$.Therefore $prior(\vec{g)}=\begin{cases}
1 & |\vec{g}|<1\\
0 & |\vec{g}|>1
\end{cases}$

The prior of $\alpha$ some how depends on the model we choose for
intrinsic ellipticity distribution .When we use the step function
model for P($\epsilon_{0}$),we find that we need to use a prior on
$\alpha$ .
\begin{equation}
Prior(\vec{\alpha}|\xi)=exp(-\xi\sum(\alpha_{i}-\alpha_{i-1})^{2})
\end{equation}


Given the likehood functions and priors we can also calculated the
marginalized likelihood function.
\begin{equation}
p(\epsilon_{\ell}|\vec{g})=\int p(\epsilon_{\ell}|\vec{g},\alpha)p(\alpha|\vec{g})d\alpha
\end{equation}


Since $p(\alpha)$ does not explicitly depends on $\vec{g}$ .$p(\alpha|\vec{g})$is
just $Prior(\vec{\alpha}|\xi)$.Therefore,we have marginalized likehood
\begin{equation}
p(\epsilon_{\ell}|\vec{g})=\int p(\epsilon_{\ell}|\vec{g},\alpha)Prior(\vec{\alpha}|\xi)d\alpha
\end{equation}


One thing to note is that the likelihood of g in patch i only depends
on the shape parameters but not dependent to g in other patch.Therefore,the
marginalized likelihood of shape parameters has an equation like:

\begin{equation}
\ell(\alpha|data)=\prod_{i}\ell_{i}(\alpha|data_{i})
\end{equation}


$\ell_{i}(\alpha|data_{i})$ is the marginalized likelihood function
calculated with data in the ith patch.From this formula we can see
how better estimation of $\alpha$ will be obtained if we infer more
sky patches simultaneously. 


\subsection{Model for Prior($\epsilon_{0}$)}

The correctness of posterior distribution of g depends on the intrinsic
ellipticity distribution P($\epsilon_{0}|\alpha$). Due to the limitation
of human's knowledge we are not able to give an analytical form of
$P(\epsilon_{0}|\alpha)$.Therefore we proposed an exceedingly flexible
model for $P(\epsilon_{0}|\alpha)$,which does not requires further
assumption on $P(\epsilon_{0}|\alpha)$.

We divide the 2-D space r$\in$(0,1) into N bins .The probability
of each bin is $p_{i}=e^{\alpha_{i}}$ .$\overrightarrow{\alpha}$
is a N-D parameter vector to be infered,simultaneously with g.

From practice we find that a prior smooth regularzation on $\alpha$
is needed to obtain a good estimation on shear g.

The prior distribution we used on $\alpha$ is : 
\begin{equation}
Prior(\vec{\alpha}|\xi)=exp(-\xi\sum(\alpha_{i}-\alpha_{i-1})^{2})
\end{equation}


Here $\xi$ is a prefactor need to be tuned .

Meanwhile,in order to show the correctness of our method ,we also
set up a simulation in which we know the true $P(|\epsilon_{0}||\alpha)$
is a Beta distribution ,and thus $\alpha$ is the 2-D parameter (p,q)
of the Beta distribution.We will show the posterior samples using
both of these two methods in next section. Note that for either model
we assume P($\epsilon_{0}$) is isotropic.


\subsection{Gibbs Sampler}

While making the posterior samples we choose to use the classical
Gibbs sampler.

In Gibbs sampling ,samples of variable $x_{j}$ is made from the conditional
probability distribution:$p(x_{j}^{(i)}|x_{1}^{(i)},....,x_{j-1}^{(i)},x_{j+1}^{(i-1)}...,x_{n}^{(i-1)})$

While the conditional distribution of one variable given all others
is just proportional to the joint distribution

\begin{equation}
p(x_{j}|x_{1},....,x_{j-1},x_{j+1}...,x_{n})\varpropto p(x_{1},.....,x_{n})
\end{equation}


One thing to note is that the conditional probability of g in ith
patch only explicitly depends on $\alpha$ ,but not g in other patches.Therefore
with $\alpha$ fixed ,the posterior distribution of reduced shear
in ith patch are independent from each other .
\begin{equation}
p(\vec{g}_{1}....\vec{g}_{n}|\alpha,Data)=p(\vec{g}_{1}|\alpha,Data_{1})....p(\vec{g}_{n}|\alpha,Data_{n})
\end{equation}
Therefore sampling reduced shear g from conditional distribution can
be reduced to 2D sampling problem,which can be done very quickly.

The total time needed to sample $g$ and $\alpha$ of 64 sky patches
with 8 galaxies in each patch will only be approximitly 25s on a 2
GHz CPU.


\subsection{Simulations}

The procedure of our simulation is that ,first we generated N{*}NP
unlensed galaxies' elliprticity from the ``true'' $P(\epsilon_{0})$,and
asign these galaxies into NP patches equally.So each patch has N galaxies.Second
we generate NP true reduced shears ,and asign them to each patch,and
then shear the unlensed galaxies using formula (4) .

Finally we can put on some noise on $\epsilon_{\ell}$ to get the
observed ellipticity $\epsilon_{ob}$. For simplicity we've only considered
the situation when P($\epsilon_{ob}|\epsilon_{\ell})$ is a 2D Gaussian.

Use Gibbs sampler and $P(\epsilon_{0}|\alpha)$ mentioned previously,we
are to sample the posterior distribution of g and $\alpha$ simultaneously
and effectively.

\section{Result}
\label{sec:XXX}

\subsection{Posterior samples}
We show the posterior samples of both g and $\alpha$ ,for both beta function and step function model.
\subsection{Bias Test}
We test the systematical bias of our estimator.(Here the estimator is the max-marginalized likelihood estimator?)
We plot $g_{1}-g_{1}^{true}$ VS $g_{1}^{true}$ ,and put on an error bar which equals standard deviation of 
marginalized likehood functon $p(Data|g_{1})$ ,and use a linear fit to determin the m,c value and their standard 
deviations.

\subsection{Accuracy Test}
We compare the mean square error of our estimator with average and the estimator that could be constructed if the true unlensed
ellipticity distribution were known.
We show how the mean square error varies with number of galaxies ,number of patches and so on.

\subsection{Measurement Error}
We show some example how our method works when there is an Gaussian noise added on the observed $\epsilon$

\subsection{prefactor $\xi$}
Discuss about how $\xi$ is tuned ,the danger if $\xi$ is set to be too large or too small.
